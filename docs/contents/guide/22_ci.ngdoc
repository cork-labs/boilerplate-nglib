# Grunt CI

The purpose of this task is to be executed in a CI environment like Travis or Jenkins.

```
grunt ci
```

At the moment it simply executes `grunt build`, `grunt docs` and `grunt dist` sequentially, meaning it will test your
code both in its source and distributable (minified, uglified) versions.
